<h2>GitHub integration</h2>
<p>
  Percy automatically integrates with GitHub Pull Requests.
</p>
<p>
  If you run your tests in a {{#link-to "integrations.ci"}}supported CI service{{/link-to}}, you're done! Percy will automatically set commit statuses whenever your CI service runs a build.
</p>
<h4>Approval workflow</h4>
<p>
  If a build has visual diffs, it will be marked as a failure in the Pull Request. You can review and approve visual diffs in one click as part of your code review process.
</p>
{{mock-approval-flow}}
<p>
  Approving a build is not required, you can still merge the Pull Request in GitHub. Approving a build in Percy simply sets theÂ GitHub commit status to green/successful, so that your team can see that any visual changes were reviewed and approved.
</p>
<p>
  You can use this workflow as a way to incorporate a simple visual review process into your current code review process.
