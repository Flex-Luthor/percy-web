<h2>API Reference</h2>

<div class="Alert Alert--warning">
  <p>
    <strong>Coming soon!</strong>
    Percy's API is based on the emerging <a href="http://jsonapi.org/">JSON API standard</a> which has only recently been finalized. We're waiting for a few more things to stabilize before committing to a public v1 API.
  </p>
  <p>In the meantime, check out the {{#link-to "apidocs.client"}}Ruby client{{/link-to}}.</p>

<p>
  Percy's API was built to accept HTML/CSS and assets, not screenshots themselvesâ€”we want to encourage an ecosystem of tools that can integrate Percy's screenshot rendering and visual diffing into web apps built in any language or framework. See the {{#link-to "faq"}}FAQ{{/link-to}} for more info.
