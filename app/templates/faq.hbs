  <h5>What is continuous visual integration?</h5>
  <p>
    The term we use to describe the practice of continuous feedback for every visual change that any developer makes. Percy is built to be easily integrated with your existing CI workflow and services.
  </p>
  <h5>How does all this work?</h5>
  <p>
    First, Percy renders a screenshot of the page and then visually compares it, pixel by pixel, to a previous screenshot. The output of this comparison creates a third image—this is the "visual diff" or "perceptual diff" that shows exactly what pixels changed between the images:
  </p>
  <p>
    <img style="width: 100%; max-width: 854px" src="/images/example-pdiff.png">
  </p>
  <h5>So, I upload screenshots?</h5>
  <p>
    <strong>Nope!</strong> You might be surprised to learn that under the hood, Percy is built to accept "snapshots" of HTML pages and assets, not screenshots themselves. This is very intentional—we want to support visual testing for any web content, regardless of the language or framework it was created in, and make it as fast as possible.
  </p>
  <h5>My tests are already slow—isn't this going to make them slower?</h5>
  <p>
    <strong>Nope!</strong> An intended side effect of our asset-centric design is that we keep all the computationally expensive screenshot rendering and visual diffing completely out of your systems. By accepting HTML and assets alone, we can highly optimize Percy to have lightweight clients in numerous languages and environments with little performance impact.
  </p>
  <p>
    The first build may be slower than usual while assets are first uploaded, but after that assets are only uploaded if they change, so there is often very limited network overhead.
  </p>
  <h5>Do you support X language or X framework?</h5>
  <p>
    <strong>Short answer: yes!</strong> Though we have a set of "officially supported" client libraries for Ruby web apps, our asset-centric design lets us support any web content no matter what language or framework it was created in. We want to encourage a developer ecosystem of tools that can easily integrate with Percy. See the {{#link-to "docs.index"}}documentation{{/link-to}} for more info.
  </p>
  <h5>Do you support cross-browser or responsive testing?</h5>
  <p>
    <strong>Not yet.</strong> But, an exciting part of our asset-centric design is that we can easily add this in the future without any performance impact or client changes on your side.
  </p>
  <p>
    Right now, all screenshots are rendered in a modern browser (Firefox 38.0.1 ESR) at a width of 1280px.
  </p>
  <h5>How do you handle dynamic page content?</h5>
  <p>
    <strong>Short answer: we don't.</strong> If you have page content that changes (auto-generated test data, timestamps, dynamic test users, etc.) you may see visual diffs in every build. You can simply ignore them if you know that they are correct, or take steps to reduce the dynamic data present in your feature tests. For example, you could use static fixture data or inject static content just for the relevant tests.
  </p>

    We are exploring features to help with this problem. Please <a href="mailto:team@percy.io">email us</a> if you're interested.
  </p>
  <h5>Do you support mobile apps?</h5>
  <p>
    <strong>No</strong>, unless your app is built using HTML and CSS.
  </p>
  <h5>Do you require my repository to be on GitHub?</h5>
  <p>
    <strong>Yes, for now.</strong> However, this is not an absolute requirement and we may support other hosts in the future. Please <a href="mailto:team@percy.io">email us</a> if you have specific needs.
  </p>
  <h5>Do you require my code to be in Git?</h5>
  <p>
    <strong>Nope!</strong> Though running inside a git environment will show more data for each build, the low-level {{#link-to "apidocs.client"}}Percy::Client{{/link-to}} supports non-Git environments.
  </p>
  <h5>My diffs are very noisy, is this broken?</h5>
  <p class="u-text-center">
    <img style="width: 100%; max-width: 430px" src="/images/noisy-pdiff.png">
  </p>
  <p>
    This is one of the hard parts of perceptual diffs—the diff itself is pixel-by-pixel, so the diff may end up looking like noise if the content shifts by any amount. You still get the benefits of knowing when and where your app has changed, but it may require more manual analysis. In Percy you can simply click the diff to hide it and view the underlying screenshot to compare visually. We are also working on better ways to address this.
