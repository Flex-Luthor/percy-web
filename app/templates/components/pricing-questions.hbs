    <h5>What counts as a visual diff?</h5>
    <p>
      Each snapshot of a page counts as one visual diff.
    </p>
    <p>
      We include the full processâ€”rendering the page, taking a screenshot, and generating a pixel-by-pixel {{#link-to 'faq'}}visual diff{{/link-to}} compared to the last build.
    </p>
    <h5>What are concurrent workers?</h5>
    <p>
      The number of concurrent workers is how many snapshots we will process at the same time.
    </p>
    <p>
      This gives you control over the speed of your Percy builds. For example, more workers can be helpful with large static sites that infrequently upload hundreds of pages to Percy and want them to be processed quickly, or for large teams with very frequent builds with only a few snapshots.

    <h5>Are there any discounted plans available?</h5>
    <p>
      Yes, we offer yearly plans that give 2 months for free (an almost 20% discount). Please <a href="mailto:team@percy.io">contact us</a> for yearly plans.
    </p>
    <h5>How easy is upgrading?</h5>
    <p>
      It's a single click, the new plan is immediately applied in realtime to your current builds.
    </p>
    <h5>Is upgrading prorated?</h5>
    <p>
      Yes, upgrading your plan is automatically prorated up to the next billing cycle.
    </p>
    <h5>When can I cancel my subscription?</h5>
    <p>
      You can cancel at any time. We do not offer refunds of the remaining billing period.
    </p>
    <h5>What happens if I exceed the limits?</h5>
    <p>
      First, we will let you know if it looks like you might exceed the plan limits. If you do go over,
      the API will start rejecting new builds and snapshots.
